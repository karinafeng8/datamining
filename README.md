# datamining

This project explored data from a memory recall study that contained text recalls from 376 participants, spanning 16 different stories. Data was obtained from the Dynamic Perception and Memory Lab at Columbia University. The project utilized different ways of encoding text recalls such as TF-IDF (.rmd) and the Universal Sentence Encoder (datamining_use.ipynb). The goal was to see which method of encoding contained the most information which algorithms could use to identify the original story and priming group when given a recall. The findings from this project (report.pdf) are important for representing memory research, and determining which features are commonly representative of participants.
